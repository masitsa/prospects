                            <h3>Laundry Terms & Conditions</h3>
                            <p>Once again, Dobi.co.ke (Dobi) welcomes you to its online website (including all content and functionality available through the http://www.dobi.co.ke domain name, the "Site") and/or mobile application (the "App"). Dobi is delighted to provide You with access to the Site, related data, Dobi's proprietary software, and content and related documentation and information through the App in connection with certain dry-cleaning and laundry services provided by Dobi (collectively the "Services").</p>
                            <p>We take every precaution to ensure that the very best care is taken throughout the process.</p> 
                            <p>But cleaning clothes is a tricky business. Fabrics can be temperamental, metal zips, buckles, beads and other bits of hardware on garments can get into trouble, colors can be sensitive and new garments can react badly to being tumble-dried depending on the way they were manufactured. These are just a few of the potential hazards.</p>
                            <p>Honesty and integrity are values we hold above all others at Dobi and we hope we prove that to you everyday. But in the spirit of honesty and clarity we feel that it is extremely important that we lay out our policies, which are put into place so that everyone is aware what terms they are agreeing to when they leave items to be cleaned in any of our stores.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Loss or damage</h3>
                            <p>At Dobi we go to great lengths to ensure that your garments are treated with the very highest level of attention to detail and care. However, in extremely rare instances a garment may be misplaced, lost or damaged in the cleaning process. In this unlikely scenario, if the mishap is our fault, the following outlines our policies for making a claim.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Wash, Dry & Press service</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>We generally use cold water both because it is the gentlest treatment possible for your garments and colors and equally importantly because it means a huge reduction in our footprint, which helps us towards our sustainability goals. We also use generic detergents (Persil, OMO). With this in mind, as there is physically nothing more that we can do to protect your garments in the washing process. Dobi will not accept any responsibility for any item that may in any way become compromised during the cleaning process</li>
                                <li>If a garment is new and being washed for the first time there is a risk that some shrinkage may occur or that colors may run. We will not accept responsibility for shrinkage to any garment during the drying process or damage due to bleeding of color of any garment during the wash cycle</li>
                                <li>If you feel that a garment is at risk of damage during the normal cleaning process, please don’t machine wash it with us</li>
                                <li>Dobi will not accept responsibility for sorting through items that are to be washed and items that are to be dry-cleaned. Dobi does not provide dry-cleaning services yet. Dobi will assume that any item given to us is to be washed. Please do not give us clothes which can only be dry-cleaned</li>
                                <li>Dobi will not accept responsibility for loss of color, shrinkage or damage to items which are vintage or purposefully distressed (i.e. jeans or shirts that are designed to appear vintage) We wish to advise that items that have been treated to appear vintage are highly likely to perform badly in the washing and drying process over a period of time much shorter than sturdily made garments</li>
                                <li>Dobi agents carry smart app which takes the count of each type of clothes you wish to give for laundry, we advise customers to take caution and be attentive when the agent is taking the itemized count. Hereafter if an item does go missing through our error, then our liability is capped at ten (10) times the value of the laundry charges of that particular clothes mentioned in the invoice</li>
                                <li>Dobi advises its customer to check the pockets of clothes before giving it to laundry agents, We would not be able to admit any claims of valuable left in the clothes</li>
                                <li>In rare instances, it is possible that an item may become misplaced or lost. In the event that a customer should wish to make a claim for a missing item, the customer must present the original itemized list, which accompanied the bag within 48 hours of receipt of laundry</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <h3>Add-on services</h3>
                            <p>Dobi does provide folding, ironing and delivery services for nominal charges. You’ll see this options as you check out</p>
                            
                            <h3>Dry-cleaning</h3>
                            <p>Dobi does not provide dry-cleaning services yet. We are working on something and you’ll be the first one to know</p>
                            
                            <h3>Wool & Cashmere</h3>
                            <p>Although our detergent is well suitable for woolen fabrics, Cashmere and cashmere blends are very delicate and can be unpredictable in the washing process. Whilst it is not uncommon for some wool or cashmere blends to machine washable, we only recommend dry cleaning for these types of garments. We will not accept responsibility for any damage or shrinkage of any item made from such fibres, which are sent to us for regular wash and press service</p>
